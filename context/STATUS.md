## Current Phase

**Phase:** Design System Enhancement
**Started:** 2025-11-25
**Target:** Complete

**Focus:** Transform website from basic styling to premium, professional design with modern design patterns

## Active Tasks

**In Progress:**
- None - design system upgrades complete

**Completed This Phase:**
- [✅] Added Inter font family from Google Fonts
- [✅] Enhanced hero section with gradient background and visual depth
- [✅] Upgraded all component styling with modern shadows and animations
- [✅] Implemented glassmorphism effect on header
- [✅] Applied consistent design patterns across all components

**Next Up:**
- [ ] User review and approval of design changes
- [ ] Push to GitHub and deploy to production
- [ ] Potential design refinements based on feedback

## Blockers & Decisions

**Current Blockers:**
- None

**Recent Decisions:**
- **Typography:** Inter font family for professional, modern appearance
- **Shadow Strategy:** Layered multi-shadow approach for better depth perception
- **Animation Timing:** cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) for iOS-style premium feel
- **Border Radius:** Consistent 12-16px across similar components

**Pending Decisions:**
- Whether to push design changes to production immediately or wait for additional feedback

## Work In Progress

**Current Files:**
- None - all design enhancements complete and committed

**Mental Model:**
Design system upgrade complete with modern patterns applied consistently across all components. Layered shadows create depth, cubic-bezier transitions feel premium, and brand-colored shadows reinforce visual identity. All components building successfully with no errors.

**Next Specific Action:**
Awaiting user feedback on design changes. If approved, prepare to push to GitHub and deploy to Cloudflare Pages production.
