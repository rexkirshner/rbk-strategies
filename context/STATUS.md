## Current Phase

**Phase:** SEO Optimization & Production Ready
**Started:** 2025-11-26
**Target:** Complete

**Focus:** Comprehensive SEO implementation, mobile polish, and production deployment preparation

## Active Tasks

**In Progress:**
- [ ] Configure Cloudflare Pages build settings (Framework: Astro, Build: npm run build, Output: dist)

**Completed This Phase:**
- [✅] Implemented comprehensive SEO (JSON-LD, meta tags, robots.txt, sitemap.xml)
- [✅] Created professional Open Graph image (1200x630px)
- [✅] Optimized mobile responsiveness (header, hero, buttons, form spacing)
- [✅] Centralized all colors to CSS variables with RGB versions
- [✅] Added legal footer disclosure for California LLC
- [✅] Created custom duotone network favicon
- [✅] Centered About section title on mobile
- [✅] Combined operations/finance into single competency with 4 condensed bullets
- [✅] Added Blockchain & Digital Asset Technologies as fourth competency
- [✅] Optimized SEO for "Rex Kirshner" personal name queries
- [✅] Pushed all commits to GitHub
- [✅] Troubleshot Cloudflare Pages deployment configuration

**Next Up:**
- [ ] Verify Cloudflare Pages deployment succeeds after build configuration
- [ ] Test deployed site functionality
- [ ] Set up Resend API key for contact form
- [ ] Configure Google Analytics (optional)
- [ ] Set up custom domain (rbkstrategies.com)
- [ ] Submit sitemap to Google Search Console

## Blockers & Decisions

**Current Blockers:**
- Cloudflare Pages deployment showing 404 (waiting on user to configure build settings in dashboard)

**Recent Decisions:**
- **Service Structure:** Combined operations/finance into single competency for stronger value proposition
- **Blockchain Positioning:** Added as fourth competency (after Tech, before Podcasting) with focus on protocol consulting, DAO work, and Inevitable Ethereum
- **Personal Name SEO:** "Rex Kirshner" in page title + rel="me" identity links for cross-site verification and knowledge graph association
- **Deployment Architecture:** Server mode with prerendering (enables /api/contact endpoint while keeping homepage cached)
- **Cloudflare Strategy:** Pages (Git-connected) over Workers for simpler automatic deployment

**Pending Decisions:**
- Resend API key setup timing (required for contact form functionality)
- Google Analytics configuration (.env setup)
- Custom domain purchase/configuration (rbkstrategies.com)
- Sitemap submission to Google Search Console timing

## Work In Progress

**Current Files:**
- None - all session work complete and committed (7 new commits + 3 deployment fixes pushed to GitHub)

**Mental Model:**
Cloudflare Pages (Git-connected) deployment is fundamentally different from Workers. Pages automatically builds and deploys after each push - no wrangler.toml or deploy command needed. The current 404 error is because build configuration wasn't set in Cloudflare dashboard, so raw source code was deployed instead of built dist/ folder. Once build settings configured (Framework: Astro, Build: npm run build, Output: dist), automatic deployment will work correctly.

Site uses hybrid Astro deployment: server mode allows /api/contact.ts to run serverless while homepage has `export const prerender = true` for fast static caching. This gives best of both worlds.

**Next Specific Action:**
User needs to configure build settings in Cloudflare Pages dashboard: Settings → Builds & deployments → Set Framework preset: Astro, Build command: npm run build, Build output directory: dist. Then retry deployment.

## Recent Accomplishments

**Last Session (Session 8 - 2025-11-26):**
- ✅ Created custom duotone network favicon using brand colors (Deep Navy + Corporate Blue)
- ✅ Centered "About RBK Strategies" heading on mobile for better visual balance
- ✅ Combined operations/finance into unified competency with 4 condensed, scannable bullets
- ✅ Removed ungrounded metrics ($100M+, 30%) that hurt credibility
- ✅ Added "Blockchain & Digital Asset Technologies" as fourth core competency
- ✅ Optimized SEO for "Rex Kirshner" personal name queries (title, keywords, rel="me" links)
- ✅ Pushed all commits to GitHub with explicit user approval
- ✅ Identified and fixed Cloudflare deployment configuration issues (Pages vs Workers, server mode, removed wrangler.toml)

**Key Files Modified:**
- `public/favicon.svg` - Custom duotone network icon
- `src/components/sections/About.astro` - Mobile heading centering
- `src/components/sections/Services.astro` - Combined ops/finance, added blockchain section, condensed bullets
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` - "Rex Kirshner" in title/description, rel="me" links, blockchain keywords
- `astro.config.mjs` - Changed to server mode for /api/contact support
- `wrangler.toml` - Deleted (not needed for Pages)

## Next Session

**Priority 1:** Configure Cloudflare Pages build settings (Framework: Astro, Build: npm run build, Output: dist)
**Priority 2:** Verify deployment succeeds and test site at rbk-strategies.pages.dev
**Priority 3:** Set up Resend API key for contact form email delivery
**Priority 4:** Configure custom domain (rbkstrategies.com) and Google Analytics

**Context Notes:**
All code changes complete and pushed to GitHub (7 commits: favicon, mobile centering, services refinement, blockchain section, SEO optimization + 3 deployment fixes). Site builds successfully locally. Cloudflare Pages project created but needs build configuration in dashboard. Once configured, automatic deployment will work. Contact form requires RESEND_API_KEY environment variable.
