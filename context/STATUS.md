## Blockers & Decisions

**Current Blockers:**
None - all development work complete

**Recent Decisions:**
- **Cross-Site Integration:** Added RBK Strategies consulting section to personal website (rexkirshner.com) for bidirectional linking and brand association
- **Personal Name SEO:** Added "Founded by Rex Kirshner" to About section + existing title/meta optimizations for search visibility
- **Navigation Rebranding:** Changed "Ethereum" to "Blockchain" on personal site for broader industry appeal
- **Section Ordering:** Consulting first (after About), Running last for professional → technical → creative → personal flow
- **Maintenance Mode:** Project entering monitoring phase - Google indexing timeline is 1-7 days with Search Console setup

**Pending User Actions:**
- Google Search Console setup and sitemap submission (required for indexing)
- Resend API key configuration (optional, for contact form email)
- Google Analytics setup (optional, for traffic monitoring)

## Work In Progress

**Current Files:**
None - all work complete and committed

**Mental Model:**

**Cross-Site SEO Strategy:**
Google builds knowledge graphs by connecting entities across sites. The bidirectional linking creates strong association:
- Personal site (rexkirshner.com) → Business site (rbkstrategies.com) via Consulting section CTA
- Business site → Personal site via rel="me" links in footer
- Business site prominently mentions "Founded by Rex Kirshner" in About section
- Both sites have JSON-LD Person/Organization structured data with matching identities

This creates semantic triangle: Person (Rex Kirshner) ↔ Business (RBK Strategies) ↔ Website (rexkirshner.com). Google understands these are related entities.

**Google Indexing Timeline:**
- Without Search Console: 1-4 weeks (passive crawling)
- With Search Console + sitemap: 1-4 days (request indexing)
- With Search Console + sitemap + backlinks: 1-3 days (higher priority)

Site is live at rbkstrategies.com but not yet indexed. User needs to set up Google Search Console and submit sitemap.xml for faster indexing.

**Next Specific Action:**
User should set up Google Search Console:
1. Go to https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Add rbkstrategies.com as property
3. Verify domain ownership
4. Submit sitemap: https://rbkstrategies.com/sitemap.xml
5. Request indexing for homepage
6. Add site link to LinkedIn/Twitter profiles (backlinks)
7. Monitor indexing status in 1 week
